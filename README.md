##Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.

##Before running script
1. Data must be loaded setting working directory as "UCI HAR Dataset/".
2. For step 5 one must load the package "plyr".

##Process description
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

##Description of files
run_analysys.R - is the script to be run in R.
